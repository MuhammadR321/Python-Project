## Brent Oil Prices: Comparison between and the time and price of oil in the US
The purpose of this project was to see a trend in the fluctuation of oil prices over the years starting from 1987 to Present Day. The code and comparison is very simple, yet meaningful as it encourages the reader to question why prices hit their peak around the year 2011. Moreover, why about a year ago, the oil prices drastically fell? It was the Arab Spring and competition in 2011 which lead to a drastic rise in oil prices, while the COVID-19 pandemic and falling stock market lead to a fall in these prices in 2020-2021. It also encourages people to think and search the reasons for the recent increase in oil and ask the important question: What factors effect oil prices?

## Notes about Google Colab
This code was written in Google Colab Notebook, which organized the code and allowed easy import of data from csv files that I had to download. To set up the files in Google Colab you need to first downlaod the data you will be using/analyzing. After you have downloaded that, you will see a folder sign in the left menu bar. You select that and upload the file you want to work with. The to actually use that file, you need to mention/call it with the name of the file ending with .csv and including quotation marks.
